        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time. Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated TV shows and films. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the character was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., appearing in the films Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008) in a cameo, Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). The character also appeared in Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and in the upcoming Black Widow (2021) through archive footage. Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" in 2011 and third in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.</p>

            <p>Iron Man's Best and Worst</p>
        </a>
        <iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man" width="800" height="500"></iframe>
        <p>Iron Man was the crown jewel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for many years, and fans all over the world grew extremely attached to the character of Tony Stark. Iron Man is a complicated hero who has many obvious flaws and personality defects, but he is lovable because he’s also a good person in many ways.
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Open Minded: While Tony Stark spent many years being mostly a playboy who didn’t really care where his money came from, he had a life-altering experience when he almost died and saw the destruction that Stark Industries was wreaking on the world. After this, he was willing to change his outlook and try to fix things. His willingness to change his mind was definitely one of his positive attributes.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Generous: There’s no design that Tony Stark is one of the richest people in the universe of the MCU, and there is a myth surrounding a billionaire figure who gives away a lot of money to help the world. While this might be a fantasy that doesn’t always happen much in the real world, the fictional character of Tony Stark was generous.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Compassionate: Given Tony Stark’s tough exterior and the fact that he uses his money and humor to keep his guard up, it might seem surprising that one of his more positive attributes is compassion. Iron Man definitely uses this hard shell, both his literal suit and the figurative one, to protect himself because he has a sensitive side. He is prone to feeling guilt, and he does care about the suffering of others. He’s also a really caring father and husband.
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Intelligent: One of the defining characteristics of Tony Stark is his intelligence. While Shuri might be smarter than him in the MCU, she’s the only one to beat him out. Iron Man is a genius inventor with an extremely high IQ, and he’s able to use his high intellect to change the world in a variety of ways. Luckily, he learns to start applying himself to actually do good things.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Self- Sacrificing: While at first Tony Stark was shown to be the Avenger who was least likely to sacrifice himself to save others, he proved pretty early on that he would die to save the world. He took the warheads into the wormhole in the first Avengers film, and he ended up giving his life to right the universe at the end of Avengers (Endgame).
